1. The Significance of Timely Delivery in Software Project Management  
Delivering on time guarantees customer satisfaction, avoids budget overruns, and preserves a competitive edge. Project managers can adhere to deadlines by:

Employing Agile sprints for iterative advancements.  
Utilizing strict timeline monitoring with tools like Gantt charts.  
Controlling scope creep through clearly defined project requirements.  
Prioritizing tasks based on their dependencies and potential impact.

2. Management of Costs in Software Projects  
Efficient cost management ensures financial viability and prevents unnecessary expenditures. Strategies consist of:

Accurately estimating costs based on historical data.  
Conducting regular budget reviews and utilizing tracking tools.  
Managing changes in scope through established approval procedures.  
Avoiding technical debt by ensuring proper planning.

3. Agile vs. Waterfall Methodologies  
Agile:  

Advantages: Adaptability, continuous feedback, and flexibility.  
Drawbacks: May lack organization and can be challenging to manage with fixed budgets.  

Waterfall:  

Advantages: Defined structure, clear timelines, and suited for fixed projects.  
Drawbacks: Inflexible and difficult to modify in response to changes.

4. When to Utilize Agile vs. Waterfall  
Agile: Ideal for projects with changing requirements (e.g., software startups, application development).  
Waterfall: Suitable for well-defined projects with specific requirements (e.g., government systems, banking applications).

5. Ensuring Quality Assurance  
Incorporate both automated and manual testing.  
Perform regular code evaluations.  
Adhere to CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) methodologies.  
Keep comprehensive documentation.

6. The Importance of Project Scope & Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)  
Specifying scope helps prevent feature creep and maintains project focus.  
WBS: A hierarchical task breakdown that aids in resource distribution and tracking progress.

7. Advantages of Project Scheduling & Gantt Charts  
A comprehensive schedule ensures efficient project flow and resource use. Gantt charts offer:

Clear visibility of task dependencies.  
Visualization of progress.  
Tracking of deadlines.

8. Key Issues Your Software Addresses  
Identify challenges your target audience encounters, such as inefficiencies, lack of automation, or security vulnerabilities.

9. The Necessity of Clearly Defining the Problem  
A well-articulated problem results in a targeted solution, minimizing wasted resources and misaligned features.

10. Non-Technical Description of Software  
Explain your software based on user advantages rather than its technical specifications (e.g., “An effortless way to manage university voting” instead of “A Django-based voting platform”).

11. Distinct Features of Your Software  
Emphasize unique capabilities such as AI-powered automation, improved security, or a mobile-responsive user interface.

12. Market Size and Growth Opportunities  
Examine market reports, industry trends, and competitor activity to assess potential demand.

13. Leveraging Market Trends for Software Development  
Grasping trends assists in:

Aligning with user requirements.  
Maintaining competitiveness.  
Planning for future updates.
